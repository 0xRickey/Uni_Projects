This is a single player Battleship game where there are two modes:
1. the player plays against himself and
2. the game runs itself and plays against itself.

This game is run in the Python console and is the first project I created to learn how to code in Java and Python along with common Data Structures and Algorithms.

Anything that is NOT in a folder titled as "Dependencies" is my code.
